Before I tell you how to set it up, it requires a SD card!
How to set up!

3. Open DCIM and the folder inside that
4. Using any software, add the image of choice on top of the template image and save it
5. Take a photo using the SD card on your DSi
6. Remove the SD card and insert it into the Computer
7. Drag DCIM onto the SD card (overwrite the DCIM already in the SD card)
8. Insert the SD card back in the DSi
9. Transfur all the images on the SD card to the system memory.
